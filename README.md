By Joaquim Hernani Duarte Fernandes
- This is a simple superhero api created with PHP/Laravel 8

Tecnologies Used:
- PHP / Laravel 8

Description
- This is a Rest API and a backoffice developed with PHP/Laravel 8. In this simple web app, users can create a superhero by adding a real name, hero name, publisher, first appearance date, list of abilities and list of team affiliations. In addition to this, uers can also update a superhero, get a list of all superheros, get details on one superhero, and search for a superhero by the real name ou hero name.

Framework: 
- I decided to use Laravel because it's such a powerful framework and is great for backend tasks. It's the best PHP framework,in my opinion, and i have been using this framework for some time now, so I feel very confortable using it. 

Setup/Installation Requirements:
- To access the app, simply use the following link: http://superhero-faurecia.herokuapp.com/api/index
